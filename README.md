# QuickSorters
## Jason Lam, Andrew Qu, Karina Ionkina
We found runtimes of quicksort by subtracting the start time (time before quicksort is used) from the end time (time after quicksort is used). We then plotted them into a graph and based on our findings, quicksort's algorithm classification is O(nlog(n)).

Worst Case Scenario: O(n^2)
Best Case Scenario: O(nlog(n))
